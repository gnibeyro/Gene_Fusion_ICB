# Gene_Fusion_ICB

This repository contains the data and scripts necessary to reproduce the results from the paper:

**"Evaluating Gene Fusions as Outcome Predictors and Therapeutic Targets in Immune Checkpoint Blockade-Treated Advanced Melanoma"**

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### 1. `data/`
This folder contains the datasets used in the study:
- **Table_S1.csv**: Clinical and demographic information of patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).
- **Table_S2.csv**: List of all detected gene fusions in the analyzed cohorts.
- **non_ICB_Cohort.csv**: Clinical and demographic information of patients from cohorts that did not receive immunotherapy.

### 2. `R/`
This folder contains R scripts and functions used for data processing and figure generation. These scripts allow for the reproduction of all the figures presented in the study.

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/gnibeyro/Gene_Fusion_ICB.git

```
2. Install necessary R dependencies (if applicable).

3. Run the R scripts in the R/ directory to generate figures and analyses based on the provided datasets.
